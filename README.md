# Student-Dropout-Prediction
This is a personal project I done using the "Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A variable table is provided at UCI Machine Learning Repository website. The url is below. Data Exploration and cleaning was done in Python and Logistic Regression was done in R. Six regression models were created and metrics are compared to determine which model is the best for predicting if a student would dropout.
